Coding Challenge Submission: JSON to Report Parser

Welcome to my submission for the coding challenge! This project automates the process of analyzing SARIF files generated by Semgrep scans, making it easier to review findings

main.yaml
This file sets up GitHub Actions to automate the scanning and reporting workflow. The actions ensure the SARIF file is processed without manual intervention

parse.py
A Python script that reads the SARIF file, extracts relevant findings, and writes a well-organized report to report.md

report.md
The final Markdown report summarizing all findings, complete with details about affected files

Prereqs

Python 3.x

Semgrep installed (pip install semgrep)
A SARIF file generated by scanning the target repository.
Steps

Clone this repository "git clone https://github.com/your-username/coding-challenge.git"

Run the parser "python parse.py"
